# AzureFrontDoor

### Detailed Use Case: E-commerce Application with Secure Serverless Backend

#### Scenario
An e-commerce company wants to build a highly available and secure web application to handle global traffic efficiently. They choose Azure services to ensure scalability, security, and performance. The architecture will leverage Azure Front Door, Azure Application Gateway, Azure Functions, and VNET integration with additional security measures.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Azure Front Door**: Acts as the global entry point for the application, providing global load balancing, SSL offloading, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities.
2. **Azure Application Gateway**: Manages web traffic within a region, providing additional load balancing, SSL termination, and WAF.
3. **Azure Function**: Provides the serverless compute backend, integrated into a VNET for secure communication.
4. **Virtual Network (VNET)**: Hosts the Azure Function and provides network isolation and security.
5. **Subnet**: Part of the VNET, dedicated to hosting the Azure Function.
6. **Network Security Group (NSG)**: Applies security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic to the subnet.
7. **User-Defined Route (UDR)**: Customizes routing within the VNET.
8. **Azure Firewall**: Protects the VNET by managing inbound and outbound traffic based on security rules.

### Use Case Details

#### 1. User Requests
- A user accesses the e-commerce website from a browser.
- The request is routed to **Azure Front Door**.

#### 2. Global Load Balancing and WAF
- **Azure Front Door** evaluates the request against its WAF policies to block any malicious traffic.
- It then routes the request to the nearest **Azure Application Gateway** instance based on the global load balancing rules.

#### 3. Regional Traffic Management
- **Azure Application Gateway** receives the request and performs SSL termination.
- It evaluates the request against its WAF policies for additional security.
- The gateway then routes the request to the appropriate **Azure Function** endpoint within the VNET.

#### 4. Secure Serverless Backend
- The **Azure Function**, integrated into the VNET, processes the request. This function can perform tasks such as querying a database, processing payments, or interacting with other services.
- Since the function is VNET integrated, it communicates securely with other resources within the VNET, such as databases or storage accounts.

#### 5. Network Security and Routing
- **NSG** attached to the subnet containing the Azure Function enforces security rules, allowing only necessary traffic.
- **UDR** ensures that the traffic within the VNET follows the specified routing paths for efficiency and security.

#### 6. Firewall Protection
- **Azure Firewall** provides an additional layer of security by filtering inbound and outbound traffic to and from the VNET.
- The firewall ensures that only legitimate traffic reaches the backend services, protecting against threats and unauthorized access.

   - VNET integration, NSGs, and Azure Firewall ensure secure communication within the network and protect against unauthorized access.
   
3. **Serverless Compute**:
   - Azure Functions provide a scalable compute service, automatically adjusting to the number of incoming requests.
   
4. **Cost-Effective**:
   - Using serverless functions reduces the need for maintaining servers, leading to cost savings.

5. **Ease of Management**:
   - Azure services provide a managed environment, reducing the operational overhead for the e-commerce company.

By leveraging this architecture, the e-commerce company can ensure a robust, secure, and scalable web application, providing a seamless user experience across the globe.

### Expanded User Requests Flow

To provide a detailed understanding of the user requests flow, we'll break down each step from the moment a user accesses the e-commerce website to the final response they receive. This will illustrate how each component in the architecture works together to ensure a secure, efficient, and reliable user experience.

#### 1. User Accesses the Website

- **Step 1: User Request Initiation**
  - A user types the e-commerce website URL into their browser or clicks a link.
  - The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the website's domain name.

#### 2. Azure Front Door: Global Entry Point

- **Step 2: DNS Resolution**
  - The domain name is resolved to the IP address of Azure Front Door using DNS.
  
- **Step 3: Request Routing and WAF Check**
  - Azure Front Door receives the request.
  - It checks the request against its Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to filter out malicious traffic (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
  - If the request passes the WAF check, Azure Front Door uses its global load balancing to route the request to the most appropriate Azure Application Gateway instance. This decision is based on factors like latency, availability, and geographic location of the user.

#### 3. Azure Application Gateway: Regional Traffic Management

- **Step 4: Regional Routing and SSL Termination**
  - The request reaches Azure Application Gateway in the selected region.
  - Azure Application Gateway performs SSL termination, decrypting the request for further processing.
  - The gateway checks the request against its own WAF rules for additional security filtering.
  
- **Step 5: Path-Based Routing**
  - Based on URL path or routing rules, Azure Application Gateway directs the request to the appropriate backend service, in this case, the Azure Function.
  - This routing can be based on specific paths (e.g., `/api/products`), ensuring that different types of requests are handled by the correct backend services.

#### 4. Azure Function: Serverless Compute Backend

- **Step 6: Secure VNET Integration**
  - The request is routed to an Azure Function that is integrated into a Virtual Network (VNET).
  - VNET integration ensures that the Azure Function can securely communicate with other resources within the VNET, such as databases, storage accounts, and other services.

- **Step 7: Request Processing**
  - The Azure Function processes the request. For example, if the request is for product information, the function queries a database to retrieve the product details.
  - If the request involves a more complex operation (e.g., user authentication, order processing), the Azure Function might interact with multiple services within the VNET.

#### 5. Virtual Network (VNET): Security and Isolation

- **Step 8: Subnet and NSG**
  - The Azure Function operates within a specific subnet in the VNET.
  - A Network Security Group (NSG) attached to the subnet enforces security rules, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to ensure only allowed traffic can access the Azure Function.

- **Step 9: User-Defined Route (UDR)**
  - UDRs within the VNET ensure that the traffic follows predefined paths, optimizing network traffic flow and enhancing security.

#### 6. Azure Firewall: Additional Security Layer

- **Step 10: Firewall Protection**
  - Azure Firewall filters inbound and outbound traffic to and from the VNET.
  - It applies security rules to prevent unauthorized access and protect against threats.

#### 7. Response Back to User

- **Step 11: Function Response**
  - After processing the request, the Azure Function generates a response (e.g., JSON data containing product details, order confirmation).
  - The response is sent back through the same path: from the Azure Function to the Azure Application Gateway.

- **Step 12: SSL Re-encryption and Routing**
  - Azure Application Gateway re-encrypts the response (if SSL termination was used) and sends it back to Azure Front Door.

- **Step 13: Final Delivery to User**
  - Azure Front Door forwards the response to the user's browser.
  - The user's browser displays the response, completing the request cycle.
